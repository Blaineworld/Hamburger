		<h1>Hamburger with Only HTML and CSS</h1>
		<p>
			Hamburgers are a useful component to any website, but they
			have a major flaw: they all require Javascript, and a
			significant amount of it. Over time, this may lower
			performance and degrade the overall user experience.
			Some people, such as myself, have attempted to create them
			with only basic HTML and CSS.
			Because hamburgers are in such high demand right now
			on the web, I've released my own tool for creating simple
			and intuitive hamburgers, along with easy-to-understand
			examples for you and others to learn from.

				Hey, guys! This will unfortunately be the last web
				portal I ever make. It's been a good run, but the
				search engines are taking over. I use them, and I would
				recommend that you make the switch with me. As a final
				parting gift from my service, I bestow upon you some of
				my favorties in alphabetical order, stylishly layed out
				using Blaineworld's pure-CSS hamburger-creation tools.

				The Web Portal Expert is no more. From this day forth I
				shall be known as the Great Linker and will direct you
				towards the most darndest things you will ever see. But
				if by pure happenstance a web portal is needed again, I
				will put on the title of the Web Portal Expert once
				more and save you all from your cyberspatial isolation!

				I love you guys . . . <span style="color: firebrick">&hearts;</span>
